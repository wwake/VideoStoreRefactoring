# VideoStoreRefactoring

This repository contains the video store refactoring example from Martin Fowler et al.'s _Refactoring_, shared with Martin's permission.

In the ``test`` directory there is a basic acceptance test (added by Bill Wake), to cover most of the statement generation code. 

You could refactor your own way, or follow along with Martin's approach in _Refactoring_. The code is just complex enough to justify using the "Replace Conditional with Polymorphism" refactoring.

Enjoy!
